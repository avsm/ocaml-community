(** Extensible vectors with constant-time append/prepend.

  This module implements extensible arrays which work very much like ropes
  as described in
  {b Boehm, H., Atkinson, R., and Plass, M.} 1995. {e Ropes: an alternative to
  strings.}  Softw. Pract. Exper. 25, 12 (Dec. 1995), 1315-1330.

  These vectors have some interesting properties:
- lower space overhead than other structures based on balanced trees such as Vec.
  The overhead can be adjusted, allowing to make get faster at the expense of set
  and viceversa.
- appending or prepending a small vector to an arbitrarily large one in amortized
  constant time
- concat, substring, insert, remove operations in amortized logarithmic time
- access to and modification of vectors in logarithmic time

{8 Functional nature and persistence}

All operations but [destructive_set] (provided for efficient ephemeral usage)
are non-destructive: the original vect is never modified.  When a new vect is
returned as the result of an operation, it will share as much data as possible
with its "parent". For instance, if a vect of length [n] undergoes [m]
operations (assume [n >> m]) like set, append or prepend, the modified vector
will only require [O(m)] space in addition to that taken by the original vect.

However, Vect is an amortized data structure, and its use in a persistent setting
can easily degrade its amortized time bounds. It is thus mainly intended to be used
ephemerally. In some cases, it is possible to use Vect persistently with the same
amortized bounds by explicitly rebalancing vects to be reused using [balance].
Special care must be taken to avoid calling [balance] too frequently; in the limit,
calling [balance] after each modification would defeat the purpose of amortization.
